# MINT Modeling Status
## South Sudan
### Backcasting

**Regions:** Focus on Pongo region (other regions by first approximation based on Pongo)

**Time period supported:** any period between 2000-2017

**Agriculture modeling for potential crop production (Cycles model):**

 * Model is manually tuned for agriculture areas within Pongo region
 * For other regions in South Sudan, the model can be tuned by hand and used

**Economic modeling for crop production (EACS model):**

 * Model is calibrated for areas within the Pongo region
 * For other regions of South Sudan, the Pongo calibration of the model could be used as a first approximation

**Hydrology modeling for flooding (PIHM model):**

 * Only available as an emulator, for Pongo region only

### Forecasting

**Regions:** Focus on Pongo region (other regions by first approximation based on Pongo)

**Time period supported:** 2018 (weather forecasting available for different percentiles).
Forecasting is based on historical precipitation within Pongo Basin.
A primer on forecasting in MINT is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FtgmknPZdTKyKauC3VPPiI7ZIfkPYAM8/view).

**Agriculture modeling for crop yield (Cycles model):**

 * Model is manually tuned for agriculture areas within Pongo region
 * For other regions in South Sudan, the model can be tuned by hand and used
 
**Economic modeling for crop production (EACS model):**

 * Model is calibrated for areas within the Pongo region
 * For other regions of South Sudan, the Pongo calibration of the model could be used as a first approximation

**Hydrology modeling:** Not available for forecasting.

## Ethiopia
### Backcasting

**Regions:** Focus on Gambella region and Baro river (other regions by first approximation)
