## Exploring areas

The **explore areas** section has three main categories: agriculture, hydrology and administrative areas.

Each category presents a group of subregions.
![Regions](figures/walkthrough/04.png "Regions")

Clicking a region on the map will search the MINT catalogs for models configured for that region and datasets with data for that region.
![Selecting a region](figures/walkthrough/05.png "Selecting a region")
![Region details](figures/walkthrough/06.png "Region details")

Clicking on a model or dataset result will send you to its detailed description page.
