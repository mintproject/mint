# Configure Models

The configuration system in MINT allows you to define how models should run with specific parameters and file requirements. This section explains how to set up and manage model configurations and their setups.

## Configuration System Overview

The configuration system follows a hierarchical structure:

- **Models**: Top-level organization of related model versions
- **Versions**: Group configurations that share the same software revision
- **Configurations**: Define specific software parameters and file requirements
- **Setups**: Provide specific values for configurations
