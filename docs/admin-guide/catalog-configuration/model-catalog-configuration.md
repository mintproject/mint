The Model Catalog Endpoint is a [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) endpoint that provides access to the model catalog data. The Model Catalog Endpoint is implemented using [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/). The Model Catalog Endpoint is used by the MINT platform to store and retrieve model metadata.

The Model Catalog Endpoint is password protected. The default username and password are `admin` and `CHANGEME`, respectively. You can change the username and password by editing the `values.yaml` file in the `mint` directory. The `values.yaml` file contains the following sections:

The default url is [http://endpoint.models.mint.local](http://endpoint.models.mint.local)

```yaml
secrets:
  database:
    model_catalog_endpoint:
      # -- Username for Model Catalog Apache Jena Fuseki database
      username: admin
      # -- Password for Model Catalog Apache Jena Fuseki database
      password: CHANGEME
```

### Initial Data

Helm charts are configured to populate the database with initial data. You can configure the initial data by editing the `values.yaml` file in the `mint` directory. The `values.yaml` file contains the following sections:

```yaml
components:
  model_catalog_endpoint:
    environment:
      seeds_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintproject/model-catalog-endpoint/main/data/wifire-2023-09-22.trig
```

The `seeds_url` key specifies the URL of the initial data. You can change the URL to point to a different initial data file. The initial data file must be in the [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) format.
