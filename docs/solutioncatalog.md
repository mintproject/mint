# Solution Catalog
## Overview
Once we execute a model or model ensemble in MINT, we save all results in the MINT solution catalog. The model information used in the execution is also saved, along with additional metadata with the provenance of the final results (which parameter values were set, which inputs were used, which executions were successful or not, etc.)

The solution catalog is accessible as a database that can be browsed, allowing users and developers to query for results that already exist. The following python notebook shows an example on how to access, browse, and filter results:
